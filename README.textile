h2. Simple HTTP request logger app written in Sinatra

This app written to compare MongoDB with Mongoid gem and MySQL with mysql2 gem. Also used framework agnostic will-paginate.

<pre><code>$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rake db:migrate
$ bundle exec rackup</code></pre>

Note that you have to create the database manually, because I don't have a rake task for that.

h2. Available routes

* /mongo/list - List all Mongo records.
* /mongo/create - Create a record in MongoDB. You can pass "qtt" param to create more then one record per request.
* /mysql/list - List all MySQL records.
* /mysql/create - Create a record in MySQL db. You can pass "qtt" param to create more then one record per request.
